Structure The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties, which are 'top down', characterized by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement.  Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an 'executive agreement rather than a treaty'.  Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress.

Impacts A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.  Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy.  Another example is the impact on fisheries: approximately 40 countries are acutely vulnerable to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on fisheries.  Developing countries with large fisheries sectors are particularly affected.  During the Cancún COP16 in 2010, donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the Green Climate Fund for developing countries to adapt to climate change.  However, concrete pledges by developed countries have not been forthcoming.

The report said it was impossible to get a precise estimate, thanks to 'murky accounting' — those figures, for instance, likely include existing loans that will have to be paid back.  Overall, Oxfam concluded that 'most developed countries are now failing to demonstrate promised increases,' with the exception of Britain and Germany.  That plateau in climate finance can also be seen in these new figures from the Overseas Development Institute's Climate Funds Update, which tracks money given specifically to international climate funds — another goal of earlier talks.  As the chart on the right shows, the world's wealthiest nations have pledged $356 million to these funds in 2013, down from $1.21 billion at this point last year.  (That said, nations often increase their pledges during international climate talks, so this number could go up during the ongoing U.N. climate negotiations.)
