Every fraction of additional warming above 1.5°C will bring worsening impacts, threatening lives, food sources, livelihoods and economies worldwide.  Countries are not on track to fulfill the promises they have made.  Increased commitments can take many forms but overall they must serve to shift countries and economies onto a path of decarbonization, setting targets for net-zero carbon, and timelines of how to reach that target, most typically through a rapid acceleration of energy sourced from renewables and rapid deceleration of fossil fuel dependency.","The initial pledges of 2015 are insufficient to meet the target, and governments are expected to review and increase these pledges as a key objective this year, 2021.

In contrast, those who live in communities where livelihood is directly tied to the environment, such as agriculture, tourism or fishing, are more vulnerable to negative mental-health impacts, according to the report.  People in indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable because climate change can threaten environmental aspects of their cultural heritage.  Climate change can be a cause of stress, which is often caused by a sense of a loss of control or an inability to adapt to a new situation.  Increased stress levels can increase the likelihood of problems such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders or depression, according to the report.  Problems exacerbated by climate change have carry-over effects on a person's physical health, the economy and the community.

Tell me more about how climate change affects developing countries.,['KILT_78449-18'],"Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called 'highly climate vulnerable') due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.  Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy.","Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called 'highly climate vulnerable') due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources.

Flooding in the Midwestern United States, June 2008 The effects of climate change on humans are far reaching and include effects on health, environment, displacement and migration, security, society, human settlement, energy, and transport.  Climate change has brought about possibly irreversible alterations to Earth's geological, biological, and ecological systems.  These changes have led to the emergence of large-scale environmental hazards to human health; such as extreme weather, ozone depletion, increased danger of wildfires, loss of biodiversity, stresses to food-producing systems, and the global spread of infectious diseases.  In addition, climatic changes were estimated to cause over 150,000 deaths annually in 2002, with the World Health Organization estimating this number will increase to 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050.  A growing body of research explores the many impacts of climate change on human health, food supply, economic growth, migration, security, societal change, and public goods, such as drinking water.  The consequences of these changes are most likely detrimental in the long term.","Effects of climate change on humans - Wikipedia Effects of climate change on humans From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Impact of climate change on humanity For broader coverage of this topic, see Effects of climate change.

Can you be more specific about the effects of climate change?,['MARCO_17_694749195-7'],"A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth. An increase in water temperature can also affect ecosystems greatly because of a species' sensitivity to temperature, and also by inducing changes in a body of water's self-purification system from decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature.  Climate change and precipitation A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of soil erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water quality is probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants.  While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect, some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture.  It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases.  Climate models show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation, such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics.","A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth.

Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an 'executive agreement rather than a treaty'.  Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress.  Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scope.

This means that areas already experiencing health-threatening weather and climate phenomena, such as severe heat or hurricanes, are likely to experience worsening impacts, such as higher temperatures and increased storm intensity, rainfall rates, and storm surge.  It also means that some locations will experience new climate-related health threats.  For example, areas previously unaffected by toxic algal blooms or waterborne diseases because of cooler water temperatures may face these hazards in the future as increasing water temperatures allow the organisms that cause these health risks to thrive.  Even areas that currently experience these health threats may see a shift in the timing of the seasons that pose the greatest risk to human health.  Climate change can therefore affect human health in two main ways: first, by changing the severity or frequency of health problems that are already affected by climate or weather factors; and second, by creating unprecedented or unanticipated health problems or health threats in places where they have not previously occurred.

Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.

Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which established top-down legally binding emissions reduction targets (as well as penalties for noncompliance) for developed nations only, the Paris Agreement requires that all countries—rich, poor, developed, and developing—do their part and slash greenhouse gas emissions.  To that end, greater flexibility and national ownership is built into the Paris Agreement: No language is included about the commitments countries should make; nations can set their own emissions targets (NDCs) consistent with their level of development and technological advancement.

There are many secondary effects of climate change and sea level rise particular to island nations.  According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service climate change in the Pacific Islands will cause 'continued increases in air and ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and increased rainfall during the summer months and a decrease in rainfall during the winter months'.  This would entail distinct changes to the small, diverse, and isolated island ecosystems and biospheres present within many of these island nations.  As sea level rises island nations are at increased risk of losing coastal arable land to degradation as well as salinification.  Once the limited available soil on these islands is salinified it becomes very difficult to produce subsistence crops such as breadfruit.  This would severely impact the agricultural and commercial sector in nations such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.  In addition, local fisheries would also be severely affected by higher ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification.  As ocean temperatures rise and the pH of oceans decreases, many fish and other marine species would die out or change their habits and range.  As well as this, water supplies and local ecosystems such as mangroves, are threatened by global warming.","Section::::Other effects of climate change.

Climate change and precipitation A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of soil erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water quality is probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants.  While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect, some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture.  It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases.

Therefore, it is a priority as president [  of the negotiations].”  He said that the G7 meeting would be vital in sending a strong signal to developing countries ahead of the Paris talks.  “What the richest countries of the G7 will say is very important in itself and is eagerly awaited by all who are in COP21 [  as the Paris climate conference is known].  “The G7 allows for real discussion.","[{'relevant-text-spans-prolific-annotation': {'entities': [{'startOffset': 260, 'endOffset': 463, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}]}}]","['At the last major climate summit, in Copenhagen in 2009, the developing world was promised financial flows of at least $100bn (65bn) a year by 2020, but in many cases the money has been slow in coming.

Structure The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties, which are 'top down', characterized by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement.  Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an 'executive agreement rather than a treaty'.  Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress.  Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scope.  While the Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-1 and non-Annex-1 countries, this division is blurred in the Paris Agreement, as all parties are required to submit emissions reductions plans.","The study showed that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries.

This means that areas already experiencing health-threatening weather and climate phenomena, such as severe heat or hurricanes, are likely to experience worsening impacts, such as higher temperatures and increased storm intensity, rainfall rates, and storm surge.  It also means that some locations will experience new climate-related health threats.  For example, areas previously unaffected by toxic algal blooms or waterborne diseases because of cooler water temperatures may face these hazards in the future as increasing water temperatures allow the organisms that cause these health risks to thrive.  Even areas that currently experience these health threats may see a shift in the timing of the seasons that pose the greatest risk to human health.

Instead of examining how climate change will affect the broadest territories with the most exposure to climate change, researchers are going to the countries that are most convenient for them to visit and study.  When I examined the existing research, I discovered that we know a lot more about how climate change will affect countries that a) are former British colonies, b) have stronger protections for civil liberties, and c) have more stable political institutions than countries without these characteristics.

Although the earth’s climate has been changing since its formation, temperatures have been rising rapidly since the industrial revolution.  By burning fossil fuels, humans increase emissions (greenhouse gasses that are trapped in earth’s atmosphere) like carbon dioxide and methane.  These emissions trap energy in the atmosphere and increase the temperature of the earth.  Temperatures have risen about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century.  Climate change affects regions across the globe, however, people living in poverty are more affected despite the fact that the 50 least developed countries in the world contribute only 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.  Climate change can bring about disastrous weather events, of which 99 percent of total fatalities and 90 percent of all economic losses occur in less developed countries.

The unlikelihood of achieving this far steeper rate of decarbonization means the world faces a global temperature increase that will rise above 1.5°C.  Every fraction of additional warming above 1.5°C will bring worsening impacts, threatening lives, food sources, livelihoods and economies worldwide.  Countries are not on track to fulfill the promises they have made.  Increased commitments can take many forms but overall they must serve to shift countries and economies onto a path of decarbonization, setting targets for net-zero carbon, and timelines of how to reach that target, most typically through a rapid acceleration of energy sourced from renewables and rapid deceleration of fossil fuel dependency.","[{'relevant-text-spans-prolific-annotation': {'entities': [{'startOffset': 167, 'endOffset': 272, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}, {'startOffset': 533, 'endOffset': 684, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}, {'startOffset': 764, 'endOffset': 836, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}, {'startOffset': 989, 'endOffset': 1054, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}, {'startOffset': 1112, 'endOffset': 1399, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}]}}]","['The updated Paris Agreement commitments will be reviewed at the climate change conference known as COP 26', ' If countries cannot agree on sufficient pledges, in another 5 years, the emissions reduction necessary will leap to a near-impossible 15.5% every year', 'the world faces a global temperature increase that will rise above 1.5C', 'Countries are not on track to fulfill the promises they have made', 'hey must serve to shift countries and economies onto a path of decarbonization, setting targets for net-zero carbon, and timelines of how to reach that target, most typically through a rapid acceleration of energy sourced from renewables and rapid deceleration of fossil fuel dependency.']","['The updated Paris Agreement commitments will be reviewed at the climate change conference known as COP 26', ' If countries cannot agree on sufficient pledges, in another 5 years, the emissions reduction necessary will leap to a near-impossible 15.5% every year', 'the world faces a global temperature increase that will rise above 1.5°C', 'Countries are not on track to fulfill the promises they have made', 'hey must serve to shift countries and economies onto a path of decarbonization, setting targets for net-zero carbon, and timelines of how to reach that target, most typically through a rapid acceleration of energy sourced from renewables and rapid deceleration of fossil fuel dependency.']"

Some things can protect people from the worst psychological effects of climate-change-induced natural disasters, such as having social support.  In contrast, those who live in communities where livelihood is directly tied to the environment, such as agriculture, tourism or fishing, are more vulnerable to negative mental-health impacts, according to the report.  People in indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable because climate change can threaten environmental aspects of their cultural heritage.  Climate change can be a cause of stress, which is often caused by a sense of a loss of control or an inability to adapt to a new situation.  Increased stress levels can increase the likelihood of problems such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders or depression, according to the report.  Problems exacerbated by climate change have carry-over effects on a person's physical health, the economy and the community.

worker_448,132_2-1,That’s interesting. Tell me more about how climate change affects developing countries.,['KILT_78449-18'],"Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called 'highly climate vulnerable') due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.  Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy.","Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called 'highly climate vulnerable') due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources.

Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which established top-down legally binding emissions reduction targets (as well as penalties for noncompliance) for developed nations only, the Paris Agreement requires that all countries—rich, poor, developed, and developing—do their part and slash greenhouse gas emissions.  To that end, greater flexibility and national ownership is built into the Paris Agreement: No language is included about the commitments countries should make; nations can set their own emissions targets (NDCs) consistent with their level of development and technological advancement.  While the Paris Agreement doesn’t have harsh penalties for countries not meeting their targets, it does have a robust system of monitoring, reporting, and reassessing individual and collective country targets over time in order to move the world closer to the broader objectives of the deal.

This would entail distinct changes to the small, diverse, and isolated island ecosystems and biospheres present within many of these island nations.  As sea level rises island nations are at increased risk of losing coastal arable land to degradation as well as salinification.

As ocean temperatures rise and the pH of oceans decreases, many fish and other marine species would die out or change their habits and range.

Flooding in the Midwestern United States, June 2008 The effects of climate change on humans are far reaching and include effects on health, environment, displacement and migration, security, society, human settlement, energy, and transport.  Climate change has brought about possibly irreversible alterations to Earth's geological, biological, and ecological systems.  These changes have led to the emergence of large-scale environmental hazards to human health; such as extreme weather, ozone depletion, increased danger of wildfires, loss of biodiversity, stresses to food-producing systems, and the global spread of infectious diseases.  In addition, climatic changes were estimated to cause over 150,000 deaths annually in 2002, with the World Health Organization estimating this number will increase to 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050.  A growing body of research explores the many impacts of climate change on human health, food supply, economic growth, migration, security, societal change, and public goods, such as drinking water.  The consequences of these changes are most likely detrimental in the long term.","Effects of climate change on humans - Wikipedia Effects of climate change on humans From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Impact of climate change on humanity For broader coverage of this topic, see Effects of climate change.

They will migrate from less viable areas with lower water availability and crop productivity and from areas affected by rising sea level and storm surges.  In spite of the cumulative stressors and challenges faced by developing countries in adapting to the effects of climate change, there are those that are world leaders in the field such as Bangladesh.

Can you be more specific about the effects of climate change?,['MARCO_17_694749195-7'],"A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth. An increase in water temperature can also affect ecosystems greatly because of a species' sensitivity to temperature, and also by inducing changes in a body of water's self-purification system from decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature.  Climate change and precipitation A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of soil erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water quality is probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants.  While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect, some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture.  It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases.  Climate models show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation, such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics.","A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth.

Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an 'executive agreement rather than a treaty'.

worker_526,132_1-5,That’s rather vague. Can you be more specific about the effects of climate change?,['MARCO_21_572388581-7'],"With climate change, the frequency, severity, duration, and location of weather and climate phenomena—like rising temperatures, heavy rains and droughts, and some other kinds of severe weather—are changing. This means that areas already experiencing health-threatening weather and climate phenomena, such as severe heat or hurricanes, are likely to experience worsening impacts, such as higher temperatures and increased storm intensity, rainfall rates, and storm surge.  It also means that some locations will experience new climate-related health threats.  For example, areas previously unaffected by toxic algal blooms or waterborne diseases because of cooler water temperatures may face these hazards in the future as increasing water temperatures allow the organisms that cause these health risks to thrive.

This means that areas already experiencing health-threatening weather and climate phenomena, such as severe heat or hurricanes, are likely to experience worsening impacts, such as higher temperatures and increased storm intensity, rainfall rates, and storm surge.  It also means that some locations will experience new climate-related health threats.  For example, areas previously unaffected by toxic algal blooms or waterborne diseases because of cooler water temperatures may face these hazards in the future as increasing water temperatures allow the organisms that cause these health risks to thrive.

People in indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable because climate change can threaten environmental aspects of their cultural heritage.  Climate change can be a cause of stress, which is often caused by a sense of a loss of control or an inability to adapt to a new situation.

This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.  Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy.","Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called 'highly climate vulnerable') due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources.

Agriculture is inherently sensitive to climate conditions and is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of global climate change.  Agriculture in most African countries is mainly small-scale and rain-fed, making it particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change.  Observed and projected disruptions in precipitation patterns due to climate change are likely to shorten growing seasons and affect crop yield in many parts of Africa.

There are many secondary effects of climate change and sea level rise particular to island nations.  According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service climate change in the Pacific Islands will cause 'continued increases in air and ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and increased rainfall during the summer months and a decrease in rainfall during the winter months'.  This would entail distinct changes to the small, diverse, and isolated island ecosystems and biospheres present within many of these island nations.  As sea level rises island nations are at increased risk of losing coastal arable land to degradation as well as salinification.  Once the limited available soil on these islands is salinified it becomes very difficult to produce subsistence crops such as breadfruit.  This would severely impact the agricultural and commercial sector in nations such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.  In addition, local fisheries would also be severely affected by higher ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification.  As ocean temperatures rise and the pH of oceans decreases, many fish and other marine species would die out or change their habits and range.

Implicit in his statement about the Paris agreement was the assertion that his approach will produce more jobs, more economic wealth and a better life for the working men and women who have been harmed by past global agreements, whether on trade or the environment, and who were his core supporters in November.  Or at least his decision to withdraw will prevent the further loss of jobs for those forgotten Americans, as he has described them.  Early in his administration, Trump said he had been elected president of the United States, not president of the world.  On Thursday, he returned to that theme, saying he was elected “to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.”  (The mayor of Pittsburgh quickly said he opposed Trump’s decision on the climate agreement.)

Can you be more specific about the effects of climate change?,['MARCO_17_694749195-7'],"A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth. An increase in water temperature can also affect ecosystems greatly because of a species' sensitivity to temperature, and also by inducing changes in a body of water's self-purification system from decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature.  Climate change and precipitation A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of soil erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water quality is probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants.  While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect, some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture.  It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases.  Climate models show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation, such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics.","A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth.

Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an 'executive agreement rather than a treaty'.  Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress.  Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scope.

The predicted effects of global warming will mean that more of what would have been 'normal' storms become more destructive, heavy rainfall becomes very heavy rainfall, short droughts become longer droughts etc.  More extreme weather events will become more common.  The worst potential effects of global warming are probably a result of melting of icecaps so causing global sea-levels to rise and flood many low-lying areas of the world including major cities and agricultural areas.  The extent to which this might happen is dependent on how much the temperature may rise and this is the most difficult to forecast.  One of the currently most regarded estimates for this future warming is 1.8°C - this is in addition to warming that has already happened.

This means that areas already experiencing health-threatening weather and climate phenomena, such as severe heat or hurricanes, are likely to experience worsening impacts, such as higher temperatures and increased storm intensity, rainfall rates, and storm surge.  It also means that some locations will experience new climate-related health threats.  For example, areas previously unaffected by toxic algal blooms or waterborne diseases because of cooler water temperatures may face these hazards in the future as increasing water temperatures allow the organisms that cause these health risks to thrive.  Even areas that currently experience these health threats may see a shift in the timing of the seasons that pose the greatest risk to human health.

In contrast, those who live in communities where livelihood is directly tied to the environment, such as agriculture, tourism or fishing, are more vulnerable to negative mental-health impacts, according to the report.  People in indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable because climate change can threaten environmental aspects of their cultural heritage.  Climate change can be a cause of stress, which is often caused by a sense of a loss of control or an inability to adapt to a new situation.  Increased stress levels can increase the likelihood of problems such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders or depression, according to the report.  Problems exacerbated by climate change have carry-over effects on a person's physical health, the economy and the community.

Rather, emissions targets for each nation were separately negotiated and are to be voluntarily enforced, leading United States officials to regard the Paris Agreement as an executive agreement rather than a legally binding treaty.  This removed the requirement for the United States Congress to ratify the agreement.  In April 2016, the United States became a signatory to the Paris Agreement, and accepted it by executive order in September 2016.

Climate change and precipitation A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of soil erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water quality is probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants.  While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect, some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture.  It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases.  Climate models show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation, such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics.","A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth.

In the 2009 Copenhagen accord, wealthy developed nations pledged to deliver $100 billion by the year 2020 “to address the needs of developing countries.”  But it’s not clear when that $100 billion goal will be reached, or for that matter, what will happen after that.  At the same time, it is growing apparent that some nations not traditionally classified with the developed countries  in the context of these negotiations are nonetheless still fairly wealthy on a per-capita basis.  So one question is whether such countries might also be expected to give money for climate finance.  “Many developed countries, not just the U.S., but the E.U., Australia, have said that if you’re an emerging developing economy and are in the position to give finance you should do so,” said Heather Coleman, who heads climate policy for OXFAM America.  The continuing divides underscore the cacophony inherent when close to 200 countries try to agree on momentous changes including how they will get their energy, and how they will develop.","Another critical area of dispute involves finance.
