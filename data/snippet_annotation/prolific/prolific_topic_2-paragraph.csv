You could use pretty goodie bags or other gifting containers and add ribbon, tags, etc. Don’t forget something to drink!  Mom’s favorite tea, coffee or wine makes a great pairing for a night of pampering.  Rosé is not only a top choice, it’s also a beautiful one!

All moms deserve a bit of pampering for Mother’s Day, so this year I decided to put together a little something for all the Moms in the family.

Plus I just love being able to pick and choose my favorite goodies to include.  Since this gift basket is for Mother’s Day, I went with the theme of “pampering” and selected just a few of my favorite at-home pampering and beauty products to give.  I especially love the eos line of lip balms and lotions, and I wanted to make sure to include a few items from their Limited Edition Spring Packs in my basket.

Making lotion from scratch is a bit complex (but definitely worth the effort), and I wanted to offer a recipe that beginners could enjoy making.  So, we begin by working with an unscented lotion base and add essential oils.  Very easy!  To learn more about making lotions from scratch, I recommend reading Making Aromatherapy Creams & Lotions: 101 Natural Formulas to Revitalize & Nourish Your Skin by Donna Maria Coles Johnson.  Ingredients 8 fl.oz.  unscented hand or body lotion (sellers of natural products and aromatherapy products sometimes sell lotion bases) 10 drops Patchouli 20 drops Sandalwood 5 drops Carrot Seed Directions The best way to blend the essential oils into the lotion is to pour the lotion into a bowl, add the oils and then mix very well.

However, sugar isn’t always bad for you.  Did you know that it makes an excellent scrub for your skin?  Sugar has natural alpha-hydroxy acids that can improve the texture of your skin.  Mix it with olive oil, which is loaded with nourishing antioxidants, and it makes the perfect moisturizer.  You can use either white or brown sugar.  Do you want to tone your complexion and tighten your pores?  Instead of using olive oil, mix the sugar with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  The citric acid in the lemon juice has natural astringent properties and is a better choice if you have oily skin.  Granulated sugar is a mild abrasive, which makes it an ideal exfoliant.  To make a homemade sugar scrub, mix about a half-cup of sugar with olive oil until it forms a paste.  Apply it to your face or body in small, circular motions and let it dry between 5-10 minutes, then rinse with cool water.  3.

You could use pretty goodie bags or other gifting containers and add ribbon, tags, etc. Don’t forget something to drink!  Mom’s favorite tea, coffee or wine makes a great pairing for a night of pampering.  Rosé is not only a top choice, it’s also a beautiful one!

In keeping with the vanilla theme, the tru mélange candle fit right it, a pumice stone and wooden brush matched as well as a bar of exfoliating and softening oatmeal soap, while being a perfect fit for a sublime bath time.  In the bath department, we also added in the before mentioned beautiful containers of body scrub, body wash and body lotion.  Next, it was time to add in a few extra treats.  Chocolates are always on my list for a pampering experience and while shopping at Sprouts for this gift basket, I picked up a couple containers of various chocolates and divided them into mason jars… because I just think anything in a mason jar is cute!  You could use pretty goodie bags or other gifting containers and add ribbon, tags, etc. Don’t forget something to drink!  Mom’s favorite tea, coffee or wine makes a great pairing for a night of pampering.  Rosé is not only a top choice, it’s also a beautiful one!

Applying Body Spray Apply the spray directly onto your skin after a shower or bath when the skin is warm and the pores are open.  Apply a light layer of lotion, paying special attention to the pulse points on your body.  Then, at a distance of approximately 12 inches, spray a liberal amount of the DIY body spray.

I can’t wait to make several more batches and experiment with some more scents including peppermint, lemon-eucalyptus, and sweet orange-lavender.  Tips and Ideas for A Great Scrub The yummy concoctions you can create are limitless.

If you think olive oil will be overpowering in a delicately scented body scrub, choose one of the other carrier oils.  I also love being able to use different sugars or Epsom salts – mainly because I had a huge bag of Epsom salts under the bathroom sink that was not getting used.

Ingredients 8 fl.oz.  unscented hand or body lotion (sellers of natural products and aromatherapy products sometimes sell lotion bases) 10 drops Patchouli 20 drops Sandalwood 5 drops Carrot Seed Directions The best way to blend the essential oils into the lotion is to pour the lotion into a bowl, add the oils and then mix very well.  Once mixed, add the lotion back to the bottle using a funnel.  Patchouli, sandalwood and carrot seed oils help aid dry skin.  The patchouli and sandalwood oils have a lovely rich scent when blended together.  The carrot seed oil is wonderful for the skin, but is a little harsh in aroma.","[{'relevant-text-spans-prolific-annotation': {'entities': [{'startOffset': 626, 'endOffset': 823, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}]}}]",['  Ingredients 8 fl.oz.  unscented hand or body lotion (sellers of natural products and aromatherapy products sometimes sell lotion bases) 10 drops Patchouli 20 drops Sandalwood 5 drops Carrot Seed '],['  Ingredients 8 fl.oz.  unscented hand or body lotion (sellers of natural products and aromatherapy products sometimes sell lotion bases) 10 drops Patchouli 20 drops Sandalwood 5 drops Carrot Seed ']

However, sugar isn’t always bad for you.  Did you know that it makes an excellent scrub for your skin?  Sugar has natural alpha-hydroxy acids that can improve the texture of your skin.  Mix it with olive oil, which is loaded with nourishing antioxidants, and it makes the perfect moisturizer.  You can use either white or brown sugar.  Do you want to tone your complexion and tighten your pores?  Instead of using olive oil, mix the sugar with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  The citric acid in the lemon juice has natural astringent properties and is a better choice if you have oily skin.  Granulated sugar is a mild abrasive, which makes it an ideal exfoliant.  To make a homemade sugar scrub, mix about a half-cup of sugar with olive oil until it forms a paste.  Apply it to your face or body in small, circular motions and let it dry between 5-10 minutes, then rinse with cool water.  3.

Since this gift basket is for Mother’s Day, I went with the theme of “pampering” and selected just a few of my favorite at-home pampering and beauty products to give.  I especially love the eos line of lip balms and lotions, and I wanted to make sure to include a few items from their Limited Edition Spring Packs in my basket.  To round out the basket, I included a few other pampering products in coordinating, brightly colored packaging.  Disclosure: This post may contain affiliate links.  Are You Ready to Sew Your Own Fabric Gift Basket?  These little fabric baskets can be sewn to any size and with any fabric to fit your gift or theme.","[{'relevant-text-spans-prolific-annotation': {'entities': [{'startOffset': 2, 'endOffset': 3, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}, {'startOffset': 691, 'endOffset': 711, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}]}}]","['l', 'ip balms and lotions']","['l', 'ip balms and lotions']"

Native American Indians were the first to discover the healing properties of Sunflower Oil which is rich in Vitamin E that helps moisturize and regenerate skin.  Allantoin is thought to have the ability to help heal wounds, sores and stimulate growth of healthy tissue.  It is a skin softener and anti-irritant.  It is similar to the Head to Toe Lotion but is less translucent in appearance.  Great to use as is or you can add fragrance and color.","[{'relevant-text-spans-prolific-annotation': {'entities': [{'startOffset': 135, 'endOffset': 150, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}, {'startOffset': 401, 'endOffset': 632, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}, {'startOffset': 821, 'endOffset': 857, 'label': 'relevant-text-span'}]}}]","['Bases Unscented', 'variety of bases including Gentle Face and Baby Cream, Goat Milk & Honey Lotion, Head to Toe Lotion, Luxury Hand and Body Cream, Moisturizing Lotion with Evening Primrose, Satin & Silk Lotion, She Aloe Lotion, and Silky Body Butter', 'contains Sunflower Oil and Allantoin']","['Bases Unscented', 'variety of bases including Gentle Face and Baby Cream, Goat Milk & Honey Lotion, Head to Toe Lotion, Luxury Hand and Body Cream, Moisturizing Lotion with Evening Primrose, Satin & Silk Lotion, She Aloe Lotion, and Silky Body Butter', 'contains Sunflower Oil and Allantoin']"
worker_387,133_3-6,What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?,['MARCO_21_822357894-6'],"If you’re using the capsules, I would use a little bit less than the recipe calls for, since the oil from the capsules is thicker. You can also omit the Vitamin E if you don’t have any, and use extra fractionated coconut oil in it’s place.  Essential oil Using essential oils in this all natural body lotion will give it a great scent as well as adding additional aromatherapy benefits.  Most essential oils also have antibacterial properties which help prolong shelf life.  I used Rosemary for this batch, but I’m looking forward to making lavender, bergamot, and orange scented lotion in the future.  I recommend this brand of essentials for quality + affordability.  Here’s the full list of ingredients and necessary equipment: Lily of the Desert aloe vera gelly Fractionated liquid coconut oil Vitamin E oil Essential Oil (s) Electric hand mixer Small jar (s) or pump bottles for storage DIY Body Lotion Method Alright, let’s get to the recipe!  It couldn’t be simpler.  (Psst… if you want the quick version, skip to the recipe card at the bottom of the post.)  First, add 1 cup aloe vera gel, 4 TBSP fractionated liquid coconut oil, 1 tsp.  vitamin E oil, and 10-20 drops essential oils to a large bowl.","If you’re using the capsules, I would use a little bit less than the recipe calls for, since the oil from the capsules is thicker.

worker_387,133_3-8,"Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?",['MARCO_49_221159351-3'],"Using natural shaving cream and aftershave is important too because when you shave, you are opening up the pores and allowing more toxins into the body. HOMEMADE LOTION RECIPE INGREDIENTS 3 tablespoons shea butter 2 tablespoons cocoa butter 1 tablespoon beeswax 1/2 cup fractionated coconut oil or any other carrier oil 1 teaspoon vitamin E oil (optional) 20 drops essential oils (see my suggestions below)  Water (if needed) INSTRUCTIONS Place the shea butter, cocoa butter, and beeswax into a glass bowl.  Put the glass bowl over a pot of boiling water to melt all the ingredients.  Remove the bowl from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.  You don’t want it to cool long, as it will harden.  Add the fractionated coconut oil, vitamin E oil, and essential oils to the glass bowl.  Mix all the ingredients using an immersion blender.  You can add a little water if needed.  Pour the lotion into an airtight container for storage.  NOTES:  You can substitute for rose water in this recipe.  Also, it is best to use filtered water or distilled water to extend shelf life.  I personally didn’t add any water and liked the consistency.  If you don’t have both cocoa butter and shea butter on hand, just substitute the other for the one you do have.","Using natural shaving cream and aftershave is important too because when you shave, you are opening up the pores and allowing more toxins into the body.
