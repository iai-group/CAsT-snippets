There are many secondary effects of climate change and sea level rise particular to island nations.  According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service climate change in the Pacific Islands will cause 'continued increases in air and ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and increased rainfall during the summer months and a decrease in rainfall during the winter months'.  This would entail distinct changes to the small, diverse, and isolated island ecosystems and biospheres present within many of these island nations.  As sea level rises island nations are at increased risk of losing coastal arable land to degradation as well as salinification.  Once the limited available soil on these islands is salinified it becomes very difficult to produce subsistence crops such as breadfruit.  This would severely impact the agricultural and commercial sector in nations such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.  In addition, local fisheries would also be severely affected by higher ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification.  As ocean temperatures rise and the pH of oceans decreases, many fish and other marine species would die out or change their habits and range.

This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, and Somalia, as well as to Small Island Developing States.  In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term 'forced riders' as opposed to the 'free riders' has been used as a descriptor.  Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.

Although the earth’s climate has been changing since its formation, temperatures have been rising rapidly since the industrial revolution.  By burning fossil fuels, humans increase emissions (greenhouse gasses that are trapped in earth’s atmosphere) like carbon dioxide and methane.  These emissions trap energy in the atmosphere and increase the temperature of the earth.  Temperatures have risen about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century.  Climate change affects regions across the globe, however, people living in poverty are more affected despite the fact that the 50 least developed countries in the world contribute only 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.  Climate change can bring about disastrous weather events, of which 99 percent of total fatalities and 90 percent of all economic losses occur in less developed countries.  Because of their already vulnerable state, poor communities are particularly at risk of feeling the effects of climate change.

Role of cities, regions and local authorities The agreement recognises the role of non-Party stakeholders in addressing climate change, including cities, other subnational authorities, civil society, the private sector and others.  They are invited to scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions; build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change; uphold and promote regional and international cooperation.  Support The EU and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries.  Other countries are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily.  Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective goal to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 and extend this until 2025.

A recent report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that $62 billion, from a combination of public and private funding, flowed in that direction in 2014, a $10 billion jump from the previous year.  Developed countries have been announcing a series of commitments to help close that nearly $30 billion gap.  The United States announced a $3 billion commitment earlier this year, Canada more than $2.5 billion and Japan $1.5 billion.  Others have contributed billions more.  When paired with private funding, that money goes a long way.  “We have every expectation of strong and robust finance continuing from the U.S. and others to developing countries,” said U.S. Climate Envoy Todd Stern at a press conference.  New research published this week showing that carbon dioxide emissions actually declined in 2014 even as the global economy grew.  That may buoy climate negotiations, in part because it demonstrates that it is possible reduce greenhouse gas emissions without automatically dinging economic growth.

In the 2009 Copenhagen accord, wealthy developed nations pledged to deliver $100 billion by the year 2020 “to address the needs of developing countries.”  But it’s not clear when that $100 billion goal will be reached, or for that matter, what will happen after that.  At the same time, it is growing apparent that some nations not traditionally classified with the developed countries  in the context of these negotiations are nonetheless still fairly wealthy on a per-capita basis.  So one question is whether such countries might also be expected to give money for climate finance.  “Many developed countries, not just the U.S., but the E.U., Australia, have said that if you’re an emerging developing economy and are in the position to give finance you should do so,” said Heather Coleman, who heads climate policy for OXFAM America.  The continuing divides underscore the cacophony inherent when close to 200 countries try to agree on momentous changes including how they will get their energy, and how they will develop.",2.0,Are developed countries meeting their pledges to provide climate financial support to developing countries in the Paris Agreement?,"[{""relevant-text-spans-single-passage-annotation"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":205,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":51},{""endOffset"":319,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":206}]}}]",x,,"['In the2009 Copenhagen accord, wealthy developed nations pledged to deliver $100 billion by the year 2020 to address the needs of developing countries.

Overall, Oxfam concluded that 'most developed countries are now failing to demonstrate promised increases,' with the exception of Britain and Germany.

By Helen Briggs Science correspondent, BBC News Published 22 April Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics COP26 The US has pledged to cut carbon emissions in half, compared with 2005 levels, by the end of this decade.  The new target will be unveiled at a virtual summit of 40 global leaders.  The announcement comes after President Joe Biden reversed predecessor Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement.  What is the Paris Agreement?  The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change.  Adopted by nearly 200 countries in the French capital on 12 December 2015, it came into force on 4 November 2016.  The deal united all the world's nations - for the first time - in a single agreement on tackling global warming and cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.  It went much further than the Kyoto Protocol of 1997.  That agreement had set targets for cutting emissions for a handful of developed countries - but the US later pulled out and others failed to comply.
