All moms deserve a bit of pampering for Mother’s Day, so this year I decided to put together a little something for all the Moms in the family.  One of my favorite gifts to give for this type of occasion is gift baskets.  Gift Baskets are a great gift option for when you need to put together multiple items or want to personalize the gift for a specific recipient or theme.  Plus I just love being able to pick and choose my favorite goodies to include.  Since this gift basket is for Mother’s Day, I went with the theme of “pampering” and selected just a few of my favorite at-home pampering and beauty products to give.  I especially love the eos line of lip balms and lotions, and I wanted to make sure to include a few items from their Limited Edition Spring Packs in my basket.  To round out the basket, I included a few other pampering products in coordinating, brightly colored packaging.  Disclosure: This post may contain affiliate links.

Tips and Ideas for A Great Scrub The yummy concoctions you can create are limitless.  Note: Olive oil is not the best carrier oil for some homemade body scrub formulas because it has a strong fragrance.

(My organic cane sugar is not cheap!)  Choose sugar for fine grain homemade body scrub, and Epsom salts for a larger grain scrub.  The oil will separate in some of these scrubs, so it’s a good idea to attach a small spoon if giving away as a gift.",1.0,I’ve never made a beauty product at home before.
