To learn more about making lotions from scratch, I recommend reading Making Aromatherapy Creams & Lotions: 101 Natural Formulas to Revitalize & Nourish Your Skin by Donna Maria Coles Johnson.  Ingredients 8 fl.oz.  unscented hand or body lotion (sellers of natural products and aromatherapy products sometimes sell lotion bases) 10 drops Patchouli 20 drops Sandalwood 5 drops Carrot Seed Directions The best way to blend the essential oils into the lotion is to pour the lotion into a bowl, add the oils and then mix very well.  Once mixed, add the lotion back to the bottle using a funnel.  Patchouli, sandalwood and carrot seed oils help aid dry skin.

HOMEMADE LOTION RECIPE INGREDIENTS 3 tablespoons shea butter 2 tablespoons cocoa butter 1 tablespoon beeswax 1/2 cup fractionated coconut oil or any other carrier oil 1 teaspoon vitamin E oil (optional) 20 drops essential oils (see my suggestions below)  Water (if needed) INSTRUCTIONS Place the shea butter, cocoa butter, and beeswax into a glass bowl.  Put the glass bowl over a pot of boiling water to melt all the ingredients.  Remove the bowl from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.  You don’t want it to cool long, as it will harden.  Add the fractionated coconut oil, vitamin E oil, and essential oils to the glass bowl.  Mix all the ingredients using an immersion blender.  You can add a little water if needed.  Pour the lotion into an airtight container for storage.  NOTES:  You can substitute for rose water in this recipe.  Also, it is best to use filtered water or distilled water to extend shelf life.  I personally didn’t add any water and liked the consistency.

Super easy.  If you don’t want to use essential oils, you don’t have to.  I’ve also mixed this with herbal infused almond oil and herbal teas to add the scent and the properties of the herb.  It’s nice because it maintains the scent from the infused oil and tea.
