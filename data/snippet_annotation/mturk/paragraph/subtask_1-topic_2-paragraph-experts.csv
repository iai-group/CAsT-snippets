Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.

However, sugar isn’t always bad for you.  Did you know that it makes an excellent scrub for your skin?  Sugar has natural alpha-hydroxy acids that can improve the texture of your skin.  Mix it with olive oil, which is loaded with nourishing antioxidants, and it makes the perfect moisturizer.  You can use either white or brown sugar.  Do you want to tone your complexion and tighten your pores?  Instead of using olive oil, mix the sugar with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  The citric acid in the lemon juice has natural astringent properties and is a better choice if you have oily skin.  Granulated sugar is a mild abrasive, which makes it an ideal exfoliant.  To make a homemade sugar scrub, mix about a half-cup of sugar with olive oil until it forms a paste.  Apply it to your face or body in small, circular motions and let it dry between 5-10 minutes, then rinse with cool water.  3.

Mix it with olive oil, which is loaded with nourishing antioxidants, and it makes the perfect moisturizer.  You can use either white or brown sugar.  Do you want to tone your complexion and tighten your pores?  Instead of using olive oil, mix the sugar with freshly squeezed lemon juice.

Once mixed, add the lotion back to the bottle using a funnel.  Patchouli, sandalwood and carrot seed oils help aid dry skin.

However, sugar isn’t always bad for you.  Did you know that it makes an excellent scrub for your skin?  Sugar has natural alpha-hydroxy acids that can improve the texture of your skin.  Mix it with olive oil, which is loaded with nourishing antioxidants, and it makes the perfect moisturizer.  You can use either white or brown sugar.  Do you want to tone your complexion and tighten your pores?  Instead of using olive oil, mix the sugar with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  The citric acid in the lemon juice has natural astringent properties and is a better choice if you have oily skin.  Granulated sugar is a mild abrasive, which makes it an ideal exfoliant.  To make a homemade sugar scrub, mix about a half-cup of sugar with olive oil until it forms a paste.  Apply it to your face or body in small, circular motions and let it dry between 5-10 minutes, then rinse with cool water.  3.
