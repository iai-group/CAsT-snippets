The United Kingdom will hold a major international climate summit in Glasgow in November — considered the most significant gathering of world leaders since the 2015 climate meeting in Paris — and Britain is keen to strengthen its claim to leadership in the area, especially as it prepares for its place on the world stage post-Brexit.  Johnson officially began COP26, as the climate talks are known, at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday.  Appearing alongside revered British naturalist David Attenborough, the prime minister declared that Britain, as the “first country to industrialize,” has a “responsibility to lead the way.”  Johnson urged other countries to match Britain’s pledge — made by his predecessor Theresa May last year — to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.  He also announced that Britain will ban new gas, diesel and hybrid cars by 2035, cutting the current target of 2040 by five years.  Other countries, such as Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, are banning fossil fuel vehicles by 2030.  Britain’s car industry questioned whether the goal is achievable.",,"I remember Glasgow hosting COP26 last year, but unfortunately I was out of the loop.

Climate stress is likely to add to existing migration patterns in developing countries and beyond but is not expected to generate entirely new flows of people.  A report by the World Bank in 2018 estimated that around 143 million people in three regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America) could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change.  They will migrate from less viable areas with lower water availability and crop productivity and from areas affected by rising sea level and storm surges.  In spite of the cumulative stressors and challenges faced by developing countries in adapting to the effects of climate change, there are those that are world leaders in the field such as Bangladesh.

Impacts A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.  Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy.  Another example is the impact on fisheries: approximately 40 countries are acutely vulnerable to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on fisheries.  Developing countries with large fisheries sectors are particularly affected.  During the Cancún COP16 in 2010, donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the Green Climate Fund for developing countries to adapt to climate change.  However, concrete pledges by developed countries have not been forthcoming.

Finance “Scaled up, new and additional, predictable and adequate funding” is to be provided to developing countries to support mitigation efforts (including forest-related), adaptation, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building.  For the period 2010-2012, developed countries have a “collective commitment” to provide “new and additional resources…approaching USD 30 billion.”  Developed countries also commit to a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion a year by 2020, “in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation.”  The long-term finance is to be a mix of public (bilateral and multilateral) and private resources.
