If you think olive oil will be overpowering in a delicately scented body scrub, choose one of the other carrier oils.  I also love being able to use different sugars or Epsom salts – mainly because I had a huge bag of Epsom salts under the bathroom sink that was not getting used.  (My organic cane sugar is not cheap!)  Choose sugar for fine grain homemade body scrub, and Epsom salts for a larger grain scrub.

However, sugar isn’t always bad for you.  Did you know that it makes an excellent scrub for your skin?  Sugar has natural alpha-hydroxy acids that can improve the texture of your skin.  Mix it with olive oil, which is loaded with nourishing antioxidants, and it makes the perfect moisturizer.  You can use either white or brown sugar.  Do you want to tone your complexion and tighten your pores?  Instead of using olive oil, mix the sugar with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  The citric acid in the lemon juice has natural astringent properties and is a better choice if you have oily skin.  Granulated sugar is a mild abrasive, which makes it an ideal exfoliant.  To make a homemade sugar scrub, mix about a half-cup of sugar with olive oil until it forms a paste.  Apply it to your face or body in small, circular motions and let it dry between 5-10 minutes, then rinse with cool water.  3.
