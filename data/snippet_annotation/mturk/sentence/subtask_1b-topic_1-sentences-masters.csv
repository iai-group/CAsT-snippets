The agreement differs from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the last widely adopted amendment to the UNFCCC, in that no annexes are established to lessen responsibility of developing nations.  Rather, emissions targets for each nation were separately negotiated and are to be voluntarily enforced, leading United States officials to regard the Paris Agreement as an executive agreement rather than a legally binding treaty.  This removed the requirement for the United States Congress to ratify the agreement.  In April 2016, the United States became a signatory to the Paris Agreement, and accepted it by executive order in September 2016.

The situation is compounded by poor reliability of, and access to, climate data and information to support adaptation actions.  Agriculture is inherently sensitive to climate conditions and is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of global climate change.  Agriculture in most African countries is mainly small-scale and rain-fed, making it particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change.  Observed and projected disruptions in precipitation patterns due to climate change are likely to shorten growing seasons and affect crop yield in many parts of Africa.  Furthermore, the agriculture sector in Africa is dominated by smallholder farmers with limited access to technology and the resources to adapt.  Climate variability and change have been and continue to be the principal source of fluctuations in global food production across developing countries where production is highly rain-dependent.  The agriculture sector is sensitive to climate variability, especially the inter-annual variability of precipitation, temperature patterns, and extreme weather events ( droughts and floods ).

Developed countries have been announcing a series of commitments to help close that nearly $30 billion gap.  The United States announced a $3 billion commitment earlier this year, Canada more than $2.5 billion and Japan $1.5 billion.  Others have contributed billions more.  When paired with private funding, that money goes a long way.  “We have every expectation of strong and robust finance continuing from the U.S. and others to developing countries,” said U.S. Climate Envoy Todd Stern at a press conference.  New research published this week showing that carbon dioxide emissions actually declined in 2014 even as the global economy grew.  That may buoy climate negotiations, in part because it demonstrates that it is possible reduce greenhouse gas emissions without automatically dinging economic growth.  But, even if the $100 billion figure is reached, questions remain over how it will be distributed.",Are developed countries meeting their pledges to provide climate financial support to developing countries in the Paris Agreement?,"The United States announced a $3 billion commitment earlier this year, Canada more than $2.5 billion and Japan $1.5 billion.",132_2-7--MARCO_03_365242258-3--3,"[{""relevant-text-spans-sentence"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":51,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":4}]}}]",x,,['United States announced a $3 billion commitment']
