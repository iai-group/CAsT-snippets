Also, while “global warming” is planet-wide, “climate change” can refer to changes at the global, continental, regional and local levels.  Even though a warming trend is global, different areas around the world will experience different specific changes in their climates, which will have unique impacts on local plants, animals and people.  A few areas might even get cooler rather than warmer, and extreme weather events can include snowstorms as well as heat waves.  back to top Why is climate change a concern?  Rising levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases have warmed the earth and are already causing wide-ranging impacts, from rising sea levels, to melting snow and ice, to more drought and extreme rainfall.

Based on this information, the COP assesses the effects of the measures taken by Parties and the progress made in achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention.  The COP meets every year, unless the Parties decide otherwise.  The first COP meeting was held in Berlin, Germany in March, 1995.  The COP meets in Bonn, the seat of the secretariat, unless a Party offers to host the session.

Here's the key design difference between Kyoto and Paris: Developing nations have already signed on to the Paris accords.  President Obama was able to convince poorer nations to agree to Paris from the start because the agreement let nations set voluntary (rather than mandatory, treaty-bound) targets that gave developing countries breathing room to grow their economies before they capped emissions.  'That's key,' Morgan said of the Paris accord. 'It's just much more resilient, I think, because you have everybody pretty much on board.'  But the true test of that resiliency isn't found in the recent rhetoric of nations following Trump's decision.  It will be when nations have to set new targets in 2020.  “I think that will be the real test for Paris,' Meyer said.

Forestry The accord declares the “immediate establishment of a mechanism…to enable the mobilization of financial resources from developed countries” to support efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and to enhance forest sinks.  Finance “Scaled up, new and additional, predictable and adequate funding” is to be provided to developing countries to support mitigation efforts (including forest-related), adaptation, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building.  For the period 2010-2012, developed countries have a “collective commitment” to provide “new and additional resources…approaching USD 30 billion.”  Developed countries also commit to a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion a year by 2020, “in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation.”  The long-term finance is to be a mix of public (bilateral and multilateral) and private resources.  The accord calls for a new Copenhagen Green Climate Fund as one channel for delivering finance and a High Level Panel “to study the contribution of the potential sources of revenue” toward the long-term funding goal.",How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?,The accord calls for a new Copenhagen Green Climate Fund as one channel for delivering finance and a High Level Panel to study the contribution of the potential sources of revenue toward the long-term funding goal.,132_2-5--MARCO_35_526302661-10--6,"[{""relevant-text-spans-sentence"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":111,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":23},{""endOffset"":214,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":191}]}}]",x,,"['new Copenhagen Green Climate Fund as one channel for delivering finance and a High Level', 'long-term funding goal.']"

Developed countries have been announcing a series of commitments to help close that nearly $30 billion gap.  The United States announced a $3 billion commitment earlier this year, Canada more than $2.5 billion and Japan $1.5 billion.  Others have contributed billions more.  When paired with private funding, that money goes a long way.  “We have every expectation of strong and robust finance continuing from the U.S. and others to developing countries,” said U.S. Climate Envoy Todd Stern at a press conference.
