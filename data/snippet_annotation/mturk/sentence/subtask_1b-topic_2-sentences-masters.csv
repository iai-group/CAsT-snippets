Making lotion from scratch is a bit complex (but definitely worth the effort), and I wanted to offer a recipe that beginners could enjoy making.  So, we begin by working with an unscented lotion base and add essential oils.  Very easy!  To learn more about making lotions from scratch, I recommend reading Making Aromatherapy Creams & Lotions: 101 Natural Formulas to Revitalize & Nourish Your Skin by Donna Maria Coles Johnson.  Ingredients 8 fl.oz.  unscented hand or body lotion (sellers of natural products and aromatherapy products sometimes sell lotion bases) 10 drops Patchouli 20 drops Sandalwood 5 drops Carrot Seed Directions The best way to blend the essential oils into the lotion is to pour the lotion into a bowl, add the oils and then mix very well.  Once mixed, add the lotion back to the bottle using a funnel.  Patchouli, sandalwood and carrot seed oils help aid dry skin.  The patchouli and sandalwood oils have a lovely rich scent when blended together.  The carrot seed oil is wonderful for the skin, but is a little harsh in aroma.","My mum loves a good, scented lotion.
