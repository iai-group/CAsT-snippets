It may also inspire you to begin making your own beauty products at home.  Why should I spend the time making beauty products at home?  1.  Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

Here’s how to try it for yourself: Exfoliate.  Create your own body scrub out of natural food products that you may have in your home right now.Here’s our favorite (and cheapest) recipe: – 1 part oil (we like coconut oil the best, but you could also use canola or olive oil – 2 parts sugar (make sure the granules are fine; large ones can tear your skin) – 2 drops of an essential oil for fragrance (optional – we like tea tree oil)Using a loofah exfoliation sponge (or just your hands), rub a generous amount of the scrub all over your body, using a circular motion.  You can spend more time on rough areas such as elbows and heels.  Rinse thoroughly to cleanse the skin.  You won’t need a moisturizer after using this scrub.  Wrap yourself in plastic wrap.  The easiest way to do this is to use a handy plastic wrap dispenser like the ones that furniture movers use.  This will allow you to wrap the plastic fairly tightly on your limbs and torso.

Oatmeal has been used for many years as an ingredient in skincare products because of its gentle anti-inflammatory properties, while honey keeps the skin moisturized.  With this amazing scrub coconut oil adds that extra nourishing effect.  This recipe makes enough body scrub for one full-body application.  What to use: • 1 cup of oatmeal • 1/4 cup of honey • One spoon of coconut oil Directions: Mix the oatmeal and honey into a mixing bowl.  Once the ingredients are mixed thoroughly, add a spoon of coconut oil.  If the consistency is too thick, add more coconut oil.  Once satisfied with the mixture, spoon into a container that can be sealed.  Used when needed on the entire body, except the face, by scrubbing the mixture delicately on the skin.
