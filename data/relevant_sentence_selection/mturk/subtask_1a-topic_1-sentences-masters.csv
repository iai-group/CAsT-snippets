There are many secondary effects of climate change and sea level rise particular to island nations.  According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service climate change in the Pacific Islands will cause 'continued increases in air and ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and increased rainfall during the summer months and a decrease in rainfall during the winter months'.  This would entail distinct changes to the small, diverse, and isolated island ecosystems and biospheres present within many of these island nations.  As sea level rises island nations are at increased risk of losing coastal arable land to degradation as well as salinification.  Once the limited available soil on these islands is salinified it becomes very difficult to produce subsistence crops such as breadfruit.  This would severely impact the agricultural and commercial sector in nations such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.  In addition, local fisheries would also be severely affected by higher ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification.  As ocean temperatures rise and the pH of oceans decreases, many fish and other marine species would die out or change their habits and range.  As well as this, water supplies and local ecosystems such as mangroves, are threatened by global warming.",1.0,Interesting.

Flooding in the Midwestern United States, June 2008 The effects of climate change on humans are far reaching and include effects on health, environment, displacement and migration, security, society, human settlement, energy, and transport.  Climate change has brought about possibly irreversible alterations to Earth's geological, biological, and ecological systems.  These changes have led to the emergence of large-scale environmental hazards to human health; such as extreme weather, ozone depletion, increased danger of wildfires, loss of biodiversity, stresses to food-producing systems, and the global spread of infectious diseases.  In addition, climatic changes were estimated to cause over 150,000 deaths annually in 2002, with the World Health Organization estimating this number will increase to 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050.  A growing body of research explores the many impacts of climate change on human health, food supply, economic growth, migration, security, societal change, and public goods, such as drinking water.  The consequences of these changes are most likely detrimental in the long term.",1.0,That’s rather vague.

International leaders stand together at the gathering of COP21 in 2015.  Presidencia de la Republica Mexicana via Flickr History of the Paris Agreement Hammered out over two weeks in Paris during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) 21st  Conference of the Parties (COP 21) and adopted on December 12, 2015, the Paris Agreement marked a historic turning point for global climate action, as world leaders came to a consensus on an accord comprised of commitments by 195 nations to combat climate change and adapt to its impacts.  President Obama was able to formally enter the United States into the agreement under international law through executive authority, since it imposed no new legal obligations on the country.  The United States has a number of tools already on the books, under laws already passed by Congress, to cut carbon pollution.

Here's the key design difference between Kyoto and Paris: Developing nations have already signed on to the Paris accords.  President Obama was able to convince poorer nations to agree to Paris from the start because the agreement let nations set voluntary (rather than mandatory, treaty-bound) targets that gave developing countries breathing room to grow their economies before they capped emissions.  'That's key,' Morgan said of the Paris accord. 'It's just much more resilient, I think, because you have everybody pretty much on board.'  But the true test of that resiliency isn't found in the recent rhetoric of nations following Trump's decision.  It will be when nations have to set new targets in 2020.  “I think that will be the real test for Paris,' Meyer said.

The situation is compounded by poor reliability of, and access to, climate data and information to support adaptation actions.  Agriculture is inherently sensitive to climate conditions and is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of global climate change.  Agriculture in most African countries is mainly small-scale and rain-fed, making it particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change.  Observed and projected disruptions in precipitation patterns due to climate change are likely to shorten growing seasons and affect crop yield in many parts of Africa.  Furthermore, the agriculture sector in Africa is dominated by smallholder farmers with limited access to technology and the resources to adapt.  Climate variability and change have been and continue to be the principal source of fluctuations in global food production across developing countries where production is highly rain-dependent.  The agriculture sector is sensitive to climate variability, especially the inter-annual variability of precipitation, temperature patterns, and extreme weather events ( droughts and floods ).

Although the earth’s climate has been changing since its formation, temperatures have been rising rapidly since the industrial revolution.  By burning fossil fuels, humans increase emissions (greenhouse gasses that are trapped in earth’s atmosphere) like carbon dioxide and methane.  These emissions trap energy in the atmosphere and increase the temperature of the earth.  Temperatures have risen about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century.

It is to give their country an economic edge over the United States.  That's not going to happen while I'm President.  I'm sorry.  My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field.  And to create the economic regulatory and tax structures that make America the most and tax structures that make most the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.  Our tax bill is moving along in congress and I believe it's doing very well.  I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.  The Republicans are working very, very hard.  We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone, but it's going very well.
