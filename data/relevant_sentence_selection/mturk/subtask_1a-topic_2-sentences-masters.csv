Mother’s Day Home Spa Every mom loves some pampering and what fun to create a special spa experience for her without breaking the bank.  I really think kids feel such a sense of pride and gratification when they can do something for their mom by themselves and surprise her too ( Dads, are you listening?! ).  Any of these fun ideas will make for a special day to remember and even if you aren’t a mom, these are great options for your own beauty regimen.  They are things I’ve learned about over the years from natural facialists or massage therapists that remind one that expensive products are not the only way to get a great beauty result or some relaxation!  DIY Home Spa Day Treatments Honey Facial Honey is naturally anti-bacterial and gentle to the skin making it a wonderful cleanser or nourishing mask.  How to Apply: Apply 1-2 teaspoons of honey to a clean face and allow to sit on the skin for 10 minutes.  Moisten fingertips and rub in a gentle circular motion to help exfoliate the skin.  Allow the honey to sit 5 additional minutes and wash off with a clean washcloth.

However, sugar isn’t always bad for you.  Did you know that it makes an excellent scrub for your skin?  Sugar has natural alpha-hydroxy acids that can improve the texture of your skin.  Mix it with olive oil, which is loaded with nourishing antioxidants, and it makes the perfect moisturizer.  You can use either white or brown sugar.  Do you want to tone your complexion and tighten your pores?  Instead of using olive oil, mix the sugar with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  The citric acid in the lemon juice has natural astringent properties and is a better choice if you have oily skin.  Granulated sugar is a mild abrasive, which makes it an ideal exfoliant.  To make a homemade sugar scrub, mix about a half-cup of sugar with olive oil until it forms a paste.

This is my personal recipe, which I've used almost exclusively as a moisturizer -- face, hands, elbows, everything -- for over a year.  Sadly, it has not yet reversed the aging process -- but my skin is noticeably healthier.  That's good enough for me.  Ingredients 8 ounces (1 cup) of raw shea butter* 3 ounces of extra virgin olive oil, jojoba oil or another non-comedogenic nut oil 1 teaspoon of vitamin E oil Essential fragrance oils (I like almond and orange)  *If you're a curly girl like me, make a hair cream by halving the amount of shea and adding 4 ounces of coconut oil.  Method Place the shea butter in a small metal bowl.  Put the bowl into a pot of water and heat it slowly, stirring occasionally.  When the shea butter is soft enough to stir but not melted (it will be lumpy), add the olive and E oils.  Whip the mixture to high heaven with an egg beater.  To speed it up, try whipping on high speed for five minutes, then putting the bowl in the fridge for five minutes.",3.0,Cool.

Making lotion from scratch is a bit complex (but definitely worth the effort), and I wanted to offer a recipe that beginners could enjoy making.  So, we begin by working with an unscented lotion base and add essential oils.  Very easy!  To learn more about making lotions from scratch, I recommend reading Making Aromatherapy Creams & Lotions: 101 Natural Formulas to Revitalize & Nourish Your Skin by Donna Maria Coles Johnson.  Ingredients 8 fl.oz.  unscented hand or body lotion (sellers of natural products and aromatherapy products sometimes sell lotion bases) 10 drops Patchouli 20 drops Sandalwood 5 drops Carrot Seed Directions The best way to blend the essential oils into the lotion is to pour the lotion into a bowl, add the oils and then mix very well.  Once mixed, add the lotion back to the bottle using a funnel.  Patchouli, sandalwood and carrot seed oils help aid dry skin.  The patchouli and sandalwood oils have a lovely rich scent when blended together.
