Flooding in the Midwestern United States, June 2008 The effects of climate change on humans are far reaching and include effects on health, environment, displacement and migration, security, society, human settlement, energy, and transport.  Climate change has brought about possibly irreversible alterations to Earth's geological, biological, and ecological systems.  These changes have led to the emergence of large-scale environmental hazards to human health; such as extreme weather, ozone depletion, increased danger of wildfires, loss of biodiversity, stresses to food-producing systems, and the global spread of infectious diseases.  In addition, climatic changes were estimated to cause over 150,000 deaths annually in 2002, with the World Health Organization estimating this number will increase to 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050.  A growing body of research explores the many impacts of climate change on human health, food supply, economic growth, migration, security, societal change, and public goods, such as drinking water.  The consequences of these changes are most likely detrimental in the long term.",1.0,That’s rather vague.

Date 1995 ( 1995) – Organized by UN The United Nations Climate Change Conferences are yearly conferences held in the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  They serve as the formal meeting of the UNFCCC Parties ( Conference of the Parties, COP) to assess progress in dealing with climate change, and beginning in the mid-1990s, to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to establish legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  From 2005 the Conferences have also served as the 'Conference of the Parties Serving as the Meeting of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol' (CMP); also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers.  From 2011 the meetings have also been used to negotiate the Paris Agreement as part of the Durban platform activities until its conclusion in 2015, which created a general path towards climate action.

The agreement differs from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the last widely adopted amendment to the UNFCCC, in that no annexes are established to lessen responsibility of developing nations.  Rather, emissions targets for each nation were separately negotiated and are to be voluntarily enforced, leading United States officials to regard the Paris Agreement as an executive agreement rather than a legally binding treaty.  This removed the requirement for the United States Congress to ratify the agreement.  In April 2016, the United States became a signatory to the Paris Agreement, and accepted it by executive order in September 2016.  President Obama committed the United States to contributing US$3 billion to the Green Climate Fund.  The Fund has set itself a goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020.   Article 28 of the agreement enables parties to withdraw from the agreement after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary, but notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country.

In the 2009 Copenhagen accord, wealthy developed nations pledged to deliver $100 billion by the year 2020 “to address the needs of developing countries.”  But it’s not clear when that $100 billion goal will be reached, or for that matter, what will happen after that.  At the same time, it is growing apparent that some nations not traditionally classified with the developed countries  in the context of these negotiations are nonetheless still fairly wealthy on a per-capita basis.  So one question is whether such countries might also be expected to give money for climate finance.  “Many developed countries, not just the U.S., but the E.U., Australia, have said that if you’re an emerging developing economy and are in the position to give finance you should do so,” said Heather Coleman, who heads climate policy for OXFAM America.

The virtual Leaders Summit will be live streamed for public viewing.  President Biden took action his first day in office to return the United States to the Paris Agreement.  Days later, on January 27, he announced that he would soon convene a leaders summit to galvanize efforts by the major economies to tackle the climate crisis.  The Leaders Summit on Climate will underscore the urgency – and the economic benefits – of stronger climate action.  It will be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow.
